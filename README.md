# Authorship-analysis-through-style-comparisons
Authorship analysis through style comparisons, the project will be focused on authors' writing style comparison to detect and match authors to their unique writing style traits such as grammar, vocabulary and phrasing, to decipher different texts from different authors.
This mechanism will create two main functionalities: Authorship Verification, and Style Comparison. The project will
require creating a new dataset in Arabic and English that includes various texts and articles from
different authors.
The project will mainly leverage natural language processing (NLP) tools, as well as Information
Retrieval (IR). Python will be used as the main programming language, machine learning
algorithms will be used to train and evaluate the model to reach an optimal outcome.
